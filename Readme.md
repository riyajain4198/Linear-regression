# Objective of the task

~ The person will study for 9.25 hours per day and the supervised machine learning show predict how much mark the the person scores

## Conclusion

- The person can be able to get **92.90 score** once he studies **for 9.25** hours per day
- The **r2 score** is evaluated and the **score is 95%** which seems to be an better model
- The above plot has almost a straight line which represent that the model is quite good enough in predicting the data based on the given dataset
